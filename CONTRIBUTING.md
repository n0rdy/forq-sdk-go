## No Pull Requests Accepted

This repository **does not accept pull requests**.

Forq is a personal tool built primarily for my own projects. While it's open source for others to use and fork, I don't have the time to review external contributions or coordinate with other maintainers.

Similar to projects like SQLite and jooq, I prefer to maintain sole ownership and control over the codebase direction.

## Alternatives

- **Fork the repository** - You're welcome to create your own version
- **Use Discussions** for questions or bug reports (no guarantee of fixes)
- **Use as-is** - The tool works for my needs and may work for yours

Thanks for understanding.
